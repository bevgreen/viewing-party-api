        has no competition. It is the very finest comic-book character movie ever
        made. Knowing the Burton, Donner and Nolan filmic adaptations of Batman and
        Superman exist helps me to sleep at night. They are Exhibit A of ''How to
        Make a Comic-Book Movie''. Nothing else has ever come even remotely close.
        These seven films (I include ''Superman II'' because it was mostly Donner''s
        work)--and Nolan''s trilogy especially--are what I imagine a great director
        like Kubrick, Hitchcock or Kurosawa would have come up with, if they had ever
        been asked to make a Superman or Batman movie. They are the easiest for an
        audience to identify with because in these the scripts most approximate human
        emotions and the typical conundrums of the human experience--in short, are
        the closest, in a good way, they come to the complexities of the human condition.

        Bruce Wayne role played by Christian Bale, shows a human being behind of the

        used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically
        a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie
        to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films,
        I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until
        my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason,
        I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".\r\n\r\nThough
        my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening
        last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman
        Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it''s definitely an epic of a
        movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience
        was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel
        of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.\r\n\r\nChristian
        Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none
        of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have
        to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American
        accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly
        for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.\r\n\r\nCountering him is the
        late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it
        impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really
        separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson''s portrayal is true unpredictability.
        It''s obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes
        a toll, and it sure isn''t easy. How exactly does one take him down when he''s
        woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing
        parlor tricks?\r\n\r\nInitially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey
        Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal
        of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early
        90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\",
        he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron
        Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this
        world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.\r\n\r\nBe it known,
        this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force
        and its counterparts can''t represent, the good that has no jurisdiction,
        no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we''ve seen

        Jack Nicholson''s portrayal is true unpredictability. It''s obvious that,
        to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it

        of the best movies of all time. Christopher Nolan has brought us the Batman
        trilogy that it made it feel it could happen today. Christian Bale returns
        as Batman, was able to perform as wonderfully as he did in Batman Begins.
        The one person that ultimately stole the show had to be the late Heath Ledger
        who played as the Joker. His performance as a psychotic clown terrorizing
        Gotham City was one of the best performance as a superhero villain. One of
        the best parts of the Joker was when he was telling his victims on how “he
        got his scars?”. Another great part was when he kidnapped a police officer
        and he was recording it while scaring the man and also giving a warning to
        Batman. The supporting actor and actresses did a good job of delivering the
        story. I was disappointed that Katie Holmes did not return as Rachael Dawes
        but the actress how played as her Maggie Gyllenhaal did a really good job.
        One of the best parts of Christopher Nolan is that in every movie of his,
        the cinematography would look amazing and this movie is no exception.","created_at":"2019-05-03T05:43:10.850Z","id":"5ccbd4ee0e0a262fcd009b52","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:21.563Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5ccbd4ee0e0a262fcd009b52"},{"author":"tmdb79614358","author_details":{"name":"","username":"tmdb79614358","avatar_path":null,"rating":10.0},"content":"A

        sickening, borderline fascist film that is simultaneously dull and harmful.
        The editing represents that of an anti-pirate commercial and the politics
        are beyond reprehensible. The film ends with a monologue about how violent
        law-enforcement and brutality is what the country needs, but does not deserve.
        Nolan clearly did not intend for any subtext, yet that is not an excuse, if
        anything, that makes it worse. He includes these scenes to make the film more
        dark and edgy, yet there are people, from suppressed countries, who have to
        live through the hardships of violence from law-enforcers and dictatorship
        every day, and in his obliviousness, Nolan thinks that using this in a superhero
        film is a good excuse for self-importance. He is a war profiteer, and exploiter,
        and this is nothing short of disgusting.","created_at":"2021-09-13T10:03:55.272Z","id":"613f220ba6ddcb002c698ab8","updated_at":"2021-09-20T16:28:41.430Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/613f220ba6ddcb002c698ab8"},{"author":"AstroNoud","author_details":{"name":"","username":"AstroNoud","avatar_path":"/6zLnrhVdSDzTjhwjKxE5xQdk2Wu.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"Unforgettable

        Ledger is outstanding in this follow up to the 2006 \"Batman Begins\" outing
        for the caped crusader. His portrayal of the malevolent \"Joker'' is confident
        and highly entertaining, treading a fine line between supreme intellect and
        total insanity with considerable aplomb. He comes back to terrorise \"Gotham\"
        after \"Batman\" (Christian Bale), \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) - now Commissioner
        in charge of the police force, and newly installed District Attorney \"Dent\"
        (Aaron Eckhart) had made progress getting the criminals off the street. The
        \"Joker\", meantime, decides that the best strategy is to rob the mob - and
        pitching them all against each other, and with the help of the duplicitous
        \"Lau\" (Chin Han) manages to secure enough of their funds to initiate a campaign
        of lawlessness that is ruthless, manipulative and good fun to watch. Not only
        has the man in black his new, potent, nemesis to deal with - but he also begins
        to realise that his childhood sweetheart \"Rachel\" (this time Maggie Gyllenhaal)
        is drifting into the arms of the new DA. it is also pretty clear that they
        are both now proving to be an useful additional weapon in the armoury of his
        enemy who knows, increasingly, which buttons to press to cause maximum anxiety
        among those who would bring him down. It''s over 2½ hours long, but really
        does fly by as the quickly paced action really does kick in right from the
        start. The story is dark and gritty but the pace isn''t ponderous and moody
        - Ledger exudes a sense of peril throughout the whole thing, but that has
        an edge to it - a sophistication that plays well against the flawed superhero
        who is increasingly having to identify and cope with his own demons. Sir Michael
        Caine pops up now and again as his shrewd butler \"Alfred\", always striving
        to keep his boss on the right side of sanity, and Morgan Freeman continues
        to feature (sparingly) and his quartermaster. On that latter front, there
        are loads of new gadgets that still have that element of plausibility to them
        (no super-powers!). On balance I think I still preferred the first film, but
        as sequels go - this takes, and will take, some beating. On a big screen in
        a packed cinema, it''s just a great experience.","created_at":"2022-07-14T06:48:17.528Z","id":"62cfbc31394a8704ae5c02a3","updated_at":"2022-07-14T06:48:17.528Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62cfbc31394a8704ae5c02a3"},{"author":"The

        and more. But, Christopher Nolan did more than make the greatest superhero

        is elevated further by Heath Ledger''s once-in-a-lifetime portrayal of the

        worse than Tim Burton''s Batman, although obviously copying the neo Nazi ideology
        of \"kill all the brunettes you can in a movie\".\r\nThis is so predictable
        and so poorly written that it boggles the mind. Yet there is a fan base of
        what can only be described as neo Nazis. I guess those fans were poor cuckolds
        who got jilted by too many brunettes at a young age, and they couldn''t get
        over it.\r\nThat''s about the entire story here. Oh, the Joker kills anything
        he sees. Whoopee. And he''s invulnerable. And he''s a demigod who can only
        be beaten by another demigod.\r\nSo, we''ve got traditional mundane Greek
        heroes and villains here, just like most Hollywood movies.\r\nUnfortunately,
        the fans of these traditional Hollywood movies are the loudest people on Earth,
        and the biggest control freaks. It''s ridiculous to believe there are actually
        this big a percentage of fans for this kind of depressing Hollywood formula
        movie making, but if you look at Imdb''s top 250, you see such movies make
        up over half of the top 250. Are they voted up because control freaks vote
        more than non control freaks? Or are they voted up because control freaks
        use many fake user names? Probably both, which explains why over half of the
        top 250 are nothing more than Greek traditional idolizations of control freaks.\r\nOh,
        and Batman turns totally gay, which would be okay if he''d admit it, but he''s
        given the choice of saving a man from death or a hot woman from death, and
        he chooses to save the man. This isn''t any real Batman. It''s just another
        contrived story line for the Nolan Nazi merit badge. They are not even subtle.
        They bang you over the head with their worship of Adolf and Eva. \r\nGod help
        the world if this garbage still has a fan base fifty years from now. But it
        could happen. We may have drug addicts and meth heads around for even longer
        than that, praising the hate and feeding the hate. It would be nice if someone
        made a real Batman movie with a real story line involving some degree of motivation.","created_at":"2023-04-18T19:52:54.996Z","id":"643ef51668b7660524ee929b","updated_at":"2023-04-18T19:52:55.078Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/643ef51668b7660524ee929b"},{"author":"Andre

        Dark Knight (2008), directed by Christopher Nolan, isn’t just another superhero
        film—it’s a gripping piece of cinema that balances action, emotion, and a
        deep exploration of morality and chaos. It’s the kind of movie that lingers
        with you, not because of its spectacle, but because of the questions it asks
        and the unforgettable performances it delivers. Chief among those is Heath
        Ledger’s Joker, a portrayal that reshaped how we see villains.\r\n\r\nLedger’s
        performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary. He’s chaotic and
        unpredictable, yet his presence is magnetic—every moment he’s on screen feels
        alive with tension. From his unsettling voice to his haunting laugh, he created
        a character that’s terrifyingly human yet larger than life. Ledger didn’t
        just act the part; he became the Joker, and it’s a performance that still
        sends chills down your spine. It’s no wonder he was awarded a posthumous Oscar—this
        wasn’t just a role; it was a transformation.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale continues
        to bring depth to Bruce Wayne, exploring his inner conflict and the weight
        of his decisions as Gotham’s protector. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent adds
        a tragic layer to the story, showing how even the noblest intentions can be
        corrupted. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman bring warmth and
        stability to a world teetering on the edge of chaos.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets
        The Dark Knight apart, though, is Nolan’s storytelling. He doesn’t just focus
        on action—though the film has some of the most intense sequences you’ll see—but
        on creating a story that makes you think. The way it explores the fragile
        balance between order and chaos, the cost of heroism, and the power of fear,
        makes it a deeply compelling watch. Add to that the breathtaking visuals and
        Hans Zimmer’s score, which pulses with urgency, and you’ve got a film that’s
        as thrilling as it is thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nHere’s a fun tidbit: Ledger’s
        iconic scene where he claps in the jail cell was entirely unscripted. It’s
        one of those moments that perfectly captures the Joker’s unsettling genius,
        and it’s all thanks to Ledger’s improvisation.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Knight is a
        film that deserves all the praise it gets. It’s intense, thoughtful, and unforgettable,
        with Heath Ledger delivering one of the most iconic performances of all time.
        If you haven’t seen it yet—or even if you have—it’s a movie that’s always
        worth revisiting.","created_at":"2024-12-17T16:32:14.192Z","id":"6761a78eb80a974245cbeebc","updated_at":"2024-12-17T16:32:14.251Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6761a78eb80a974245cbeebc"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":15}'
